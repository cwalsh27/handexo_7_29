This repository contains the firmware and Python tools for controlling the **NML Hand Exoskeleton**‚Äîa modular, open-source robotic hand exoskeleton platform for research and prototyping.

## üöÄ Overview

The **NML Hand Exoskeleton** includes:
- ü¶æ Microcontroller firmware (Arduino/C++): real-time motor control and communication.
- üêç Python API: high-level interface for controlling the device.
- üõ†Ô∏è Demo scripts: examples of using the device with real-time EMG streaming and GUI control.

Code was tested on **Windows 11**, **Python 3.10**.

---

## Installation 

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neuro-Mechatronics-Interfaces/NML_Hand_Exo.git
cd NML_Hand_Exo
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

Choose one of the following methods to create a virtual environment for this project:
   - Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) :
      ```bash
      conda create -n handexo
      conda activate handexo
      ```
   - or using Python's virtualenv:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .handexo
     source .handexo/bin/activate # On Linux/Mac
     call .handexo/Scripts/activate # On Windows
     ```
  
### 3. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For local development, you can also install the python API as a package 
```bash
pip install -e .
```
   
## Exo Firmware

The exo device uses an [openRB-150](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/openrb-150/) microcontroller from ROBOTIS. The firmware is located in `src/cpp/nml_hand_exo` and can be uploaded via the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). 

The firmware includes a class NMLHandExo, which handles:

- Dynamixel initialization and setup
- Motor control by ID, name, or alias
- Joint limits and angle-to-position conversion
- Calibration and LED feedback
- Serial command parsing

To upload the firmware:

1. Open `nml_hand_exo.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
2. Select the correct board and port under Tools.
3. Upload the sketch.

## Usage

An example of using the Python API for scripting and control:
```python
from nml_hand_exo.hand_exo import HandExo

exo = HandExo('COM3', baudrate=57600)
exo.enable_motor(1)
exo.set_motor_angle(1, 45)
angle = exo.get_motor_angle(1)
print(f"Motor angle: {angle} degrees")
exo.disable_motor(1)
```

You can control the hand exoskeleton over USB or Bluetooth using simple, structured serial commands. For example:

- `set_angle:WRIST:30` ‚Äî set wrist motor to 30 degrees.

- `enable:1` ‚Äî enable motor 1 torque.

- `get_angle:1` ‚Äî query relative angle.

Supported aliases are `THUMB`, `INDEX`, `MIDDLE`, `RING`, `PINKY`, `WRIST`

For a complete list of commands, see the [Usage Guide](https://yourusername.github.io/NML_Hand_Exo/usage.html).

## Demo

#### MindRove EMG Streaming

![](/docs/source/_static/pyqtemg.gif)

A demo script is included to showcase real-time plotting of EMG signals from a connected MindRove EMG band. 
1) Connect your MindRove EMG Band to the PC (using a Wifi dongle if you want to maintain internet connection on a separate wifi network)
2) Run the demo script
